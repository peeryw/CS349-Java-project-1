# CS349-Java-project-1
Introduction: In this assignment you will create a Java program that takes the place of a physical photo album.

Assignment: Write a stand alone Java program that can be used to both view and maintain entries in a digital photo album.
 Your solution should have two modes: (1) a browse mode, and (2) a maintenance mode. 
 While in browse mode the user should be able to move forward or backwards through a list of pictures.
 Each picture should include an optional description and date when the photo was taken. While in 
 the maintenance mode the user should be able to update an existing image, update the data associated 
 with an image, delete an image, and add new images.

More specifically your program should provide the following features:

1. The user should be able to move forward, backward or jump to a specific picture.
2. The user interface (UI) should display the number of the current picture as well as total number of pictures.
3. In browse mode it shouldn't be possible to change date or description.
4. Data should be stored externally so that changes persistent between runs.
